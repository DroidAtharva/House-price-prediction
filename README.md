# Task 01: House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Description
This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key features such as **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**. The goal is to provide accurate price predictions for real estate analysis.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- The dataset contains detailed information about houses, including their features and prices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - sklearn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) and place the CSV file in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```
5. View the results, including the model's accuracy and visualizations of predictions.

## Output
- Predicted house prices based on input features.
- Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².
